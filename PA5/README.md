# Building and Running

In the PA5 Directory type in the following order:

```
   mkdir build
   cp makefile build/
   cd build/
   make
   ./texture_loader 
```

# Operation Instructions

## Before Running

```
	1) Make sure that any .obj files you intend to load are placed in the asset folder
	2) Ensure that their .mtl files are located in the asset folder as well
	3) A .obj has been uploaded to the github for quick testing (pinballbox.obj)
```

## Upon Running

```
1) The window will hang as a prompt appears in the terminal
2) Put in only the filename with the .obj extension (the program will handle the pathing to the assets folder)
3) The program will continue normally upon input
```

# Misc Notes

## Graduate Work 

The colors from the mtl associated with the .obj file included in the assets folder will load successfully
